#### plan

- add debug info about ship (position, velocity, distance from nearest planet)
- try on multiplayer with nodejs and sockets
- need to decide after that where to do physics computations (client/server) and what data to send (position/controls)
- add zoom
- try to add planet / terrain generation
- add atmosphere
- add sun and make planets orbiting it
- add a way to modify rocket
- resource gathering, part building etc...
